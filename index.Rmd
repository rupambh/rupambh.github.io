Hi! I am Rupam Bhattacharyya. I am a Post-doctoral Biostatistician at the [Michigan Center for Translational Pathology](https://pathology.med.umich.edu/mctp/), led by Prof. Arul Chinnaiyan. Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at the [Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/), where I was supervised jointly by [Prof. Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/baladandayuthapani-veerabhadran.html) and [Prof. Nicholas Henderson](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/henderson-nicholas.html).

My research primarily focuses on precision oncology, epidemiological modeling, and Bayesian statistics, alongside other avenues of Biostatistics. Over the past six years, I have gained extensive experience in biostatistical modeling of patient-level molecular and clinical data, using Bayesian statistics and machine learning tools. I have worked on multiple disease fronts, including precision oncology, infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and rare pediatric anomalies.

Born in the serene city of [Krishnanagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnanagar,_Nadia) in West Bengal, India, I spent the larger part of my childhood in the nearby town of [Santipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantipur), where I did my schooling from [Shishu Kakali Primary School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/) and [Santipur Municipal High School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/). I then joined the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) to get my bachelor's and master's degrees in Statistics.
