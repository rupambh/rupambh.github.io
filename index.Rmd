Hi! I am Rupam Bhattacharyya. I am a **Data Scientist at Google**. Prior to this, I was a Post-doctoral Biostatistician at the [Michigan Center for Translational Pathology](https://pathology.med.umich.edu/mctp/), led by Prof. Arul Chinnaiyan. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at the [Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/), where I was supervised jointly by [Prof. Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/baladandayuthapani-veerabhadran.html) and [Prof. Nicholas Henderson](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/henderson-nicholas.html).

My research primarily focuses on **advanced analytical and statistical modeling**, with core interests in **Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and AI**. Over the past seven-plus years, I have gained extensive experience in transforming complex, high-dimensional data into actionable insights, drawing from domains like **biomedical data science, computational epidemiology, and personalized systems**. I'm passionate about **unleashing data's power** to solve critical real-world challenges across diverse fields.

Born in the serene city of [Krishnanagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnanagar,_Nadia) in West Bengal, India, I spent the larger part of my childhood in the nearby town of [Santipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantipur), where I did my schooling from [Shishu Kakali Primary School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/) and [Santipur Municipal High School](https://www.facebook.com/smhs.santipur/). I then joined the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) to get my bachelor's and master's degrees in Statistics.
